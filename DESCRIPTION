Description: Fits unimodal and multimodal gambin distributions to species-abundance distributions
    from ecological data. 'gambin' is short for 'gamma-binomial'. The main function
    is fit_abundances(), which estimates the 'alpha' parameter(s) of the gambin distribution
    using maximum likelihood. Functions are also provided to generate the gambin distribution 
    and for calculating likelihood statistics.
